      "2.  **Data Understanding:** Exploring and getting familiar with the data. This involves collecting, cleaning, and understanding the data's structure, quality, and meaning.\n",

      "    *   **Integration:** Combining data from multiple sources.\n",
      "    *   **Transformation:** Normalizing or aggregating data to make it suitable for mining.\n",
      "    *   **Reduction:** Reducing the size of the dataset while preserving important information.\n",
      "4.  **Modeling:** Selecting and applying appropriate data mining techniques (algorithms) to discover patterns. This is where the \"mining\" happens.\n",
      "5.  **Evaluation:** Assessing the quality and usefulness of the discovered patterns. Do they make sense? Are they statistically significant? Do they meet the business objectives?\n",

      "*   **Classification:** Categorizing data into predefined classes (e.g., predicting whether a customer will churn or not).\n",
      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",
      "*   **Regression:** Predicting a continuous numerical value (e.g., predicting the price of a house based on its features).\n",
      "*   **Anomaly Detection (Outlier Detection):** Identifying data points that deviate significantly from the norm (e.g., detecting fraudulent transactions).\n",

    "By default, an LLM responds with unstructured, free-form text. For data mining, this is often impractical, as we need data in a predictable format to load into tools like a pandas DataFrame for analysis. **Structured output** is a powerful feature that forces the model to return its response in a specific, machine-readable format, such as JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to enabling this is to provide the model with a **response schema**. This schema acts as a strict template or blueprint that the model's output must conform to. Instead of generating a paragraph, the model will fill in the fields defined in your schema with the relevant information it extracts from the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we define this schema using Python classes. Think of each class as defining a JSON object:\n",

    "*   The **type hints** for those attributes (e.g., `str`, `list`) tell the model what kind of data is expected for each key's value.\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **Precise Grounding:** Its core feature. It maps every extracted item to its exact character position in the original text, allowing for easy verification.\n",
    "*   **Reliable Structured Output:** Uses examples (few-shot prompting) to ensure the LLM's output consistently follows a predefined format.\n",
    "*   **Adaptable & No Fine-Tuning:** Can be adapted to any domain (e.g., legal, medical) simply by changing the examples and instructions, without needing to retrain a model.\n",
    "*   **Handles Long Documents:** Built to process lengthy texts that might exceed an LLM's standard context window.\n",
    "*   **Flexible LLM Support:** It is model-agnostic and works with various LLMs like Gemini, OpenAI models, and even local open-source models through Ollama.\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

So, `if you don't want to see the error you can just wait 1 minute` after one cell finished processing. But `even if there is an error showing it is fine`, internally in the code `there is a retry that happens every 15 seconds` until we finish processing our sampled data. `The lab is designed to never reach the total rate limit per day quota.`"

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
